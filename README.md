To begin with this project, you must first install all the required libraries on your machine. Use the following commands:

pip install numpy
pip install cvzone
pip install opencv-python

Once the installations are complete, follow these steps:

Running the Test Script: After installing the libraries, you can run the Test.py file to test the model.

Creating Your Own Dataset: If you wish to create your own dataset, run the main.py file. Press 's' to start capturing snapshots within the given frame.

Model Training: The model was trained using Teachable Machine with a dataset containing 26 labels. Training a model with 26 labels requires significant time, patience, and hardware resources (like a good GPU or CPU). Once the model was trained, it was loaded into the Test.py file for testing and use.
