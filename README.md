Hi There I am here with you to guide through the project.
To begin with project first you must install all libraries required for the project, below are the list of the libraries to be install to your machines...

pip install numpy
pip install cvzone
pip install opencv-python

after installing run the Test.py file.

and if you wish to create your own dataset, you must run the main.py file after pressing 's' it will start to snapshot the images in given frame.

The models was trained using Techable Machine with dataset provided with 26 labels, beacuse Training model with 26 labels requires more time, patience and good GPU or CPU.
after the model was trained, then it was loaded in Test.py python file.
